# Deployment Workflow Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your repo: **Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions**
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. Add these three secrets:

| Name | Value | How to Get |
|------|-------|------------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | your-vercel-token | [Create Token](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | team_xxxxx | From `.vercel/project.json` |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | prj_xxxxx | From `.vercel/project.json` |

### Step 2: Get Your Vercel IDs

```bash
# Run this in your project directory
vercel link

# Then view the IDs
cat .vercel/project.json
```

### Step 3: Enable the Workflow

The workflow is already created at `.github/workflows/optimal-deploy.yml` and will automatically run on:
- âœ… Push to `master` â†’ Production deployment
- âœ… Push to other branches â†’ Preview deployment
- âœ… Pull requests â†’ Preview deployment + PR comment

### Step 4: Test It

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test-deployment

# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> test.md

# Commit and push
git add test.md
git commit -m "test: Verify deployment workflow"
git push origin test-deployment

# Go to GitHub Actions tab to watch it run!
```

## âœ… Verification

After setup, verify:

1. **GitHub Actions tab** shows the workflow running
2. **Vercel dashboard** shows the deployment
3. **PR comments** include deployment URLs (if applicable)

## ðŸ†˜ Quick Troubleshooting

**Workflow fails?**
```bash
# Check the logs in GitHub Actions
# Common fixes:
1. Verify all 3 secrets are set correctly
2. Make sure VERCEL_TOKEN has deployment permissions
3. Check that branch names match (master vs main)
```

**Need help?**
```bash
# Use Claude Code's deploy-check command
/deploy-check
```
