From century-old heritage homes in the Glebe to modern condos downtown, each property type requires careful consideration of style, functionality, and installation requirements.</p>\n\n      <h2>Understanding Ottawa's Housing Styles</h2>\n      <p>Ottawa's rich architectural history means homeowners encounter everything from Victorian-era homes with high ceilings and ornate details to contemporary builds with clean lines and open concepts. Each style demands a different approach to closet door selection.</p>\n\n      <h3>Heritage Homes (Pre-1940)</h3>\n      <p>Heritage homes in neighborhoods like New Edinburgh, Sandy Hill, and the Glebe often feature:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>High ceilings (9-12 feet)</li>\n        <li>Unique room layouts</li>\n        <li>Original hardwood floors</li>\n        <li>Period-appropriate trim and moldings</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>For these homes, consider traditional panel doors or custom-sized options that complement the existing architecture. Renin's Provincial series works beautifully in heritage settings.</p>\n\n      <h3>Mid-Century Homes (1940-1980)</h3>\n      <p>Found throughout Nepean, Kanata, and Orleans, these homes typically feature:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Standard 8-foot ceilings</li>\n        <li>Practical layouts</li>\n        <li>Mix of original and updated features</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>These homes offer flexibility for both traditional and contemporary door styles. Bypass doors work particularly well for smaller bedrooms common in this era.</p>\n\n      <h3>Modern Homes (1980-Present)</h3>\n      <p>Contemporary Ottawa homes, especially in Barrhaven and newer Kanata developments, feature:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Open floor plans</li>\n        <li>9-foot ceilings</li>\n        <li>Large master suites with walk-in closets</li>\n        <li>Clean, minimalist design</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Modern barn doors and sleek bypass systems complement these homes perfectly.</p>\n\n      <h2>Climate Considerations for Ottawa</h2>\n      <p>Ottawa's climate presents unique challenges:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Temperature fluctuations:</strong> Choose materials that handle expansion and contraction</li>\n        <li><strong>Humidity changes:</strong> Proper sealing prevents warping</li>\n        <li><strong>Heating season:</strong> Well-fitted doors improve energy efficiency</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h2>Popular Choices by Neighborhood</h2>\n      <h3>Downtown Ottawa & Centretown</h3>\n      <p>Condo living requires space-saving solutions. Bypass doors and compact bifolds are popular choices.</p>\n\n      <h3>Kanata & Barrhaven</h3>\n      <p>Family homes benefit from durable, easy-to-clean finishes. Barn doors add character to open-concept layouts.</p>\n\n      <h3>Orleans & Nepean</h3>\n      <p>Mix of traditional and contemporary styles allows for versatile door choices based on home age and personal preference.</p>\n\n      <h2>Working with a Professional</h2>\n      <p>As Ottawa's authorized Renin dealer, PG Closets understands local building codes, climate considerations, and architectural styles.
