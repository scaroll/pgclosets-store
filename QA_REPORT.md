   <main role="main">
   <nav aria-label="Main navigation">

   <!-- Add skip link -->
   <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
   ```

2. **Touch Target Optimization**
   ```css
   /* Ensure minimum 44x44px touch targets */
   .button, .clickable-target {
     min-width: 44px;
     min-height: 44px;
     padding: 12px;
   }
   ```

3. **Focus Management**
   ```css
   /* Visible focus indicators */
   :focus-visible {
