---

## Schema Graph Implementation

### Combined Schemas Using @graph
Multiple schemas are combined using the `@graph` property for pages requiring multiple schema types:

**Root Layout (Sitewide):**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    { "@type": "Organization", ... },
    { "@type": "WebSite", ... }
  ]
}
```

**Product Pages:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    { "@type": "Product", ... },
    { "@type": "BreadcrumbList", ... }
  ]
}
```

**FAQ Page:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    { "@type": "FAQPage", ... },
    { "@type": "BreadcrumbList", ... }
  ]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Single schema block per page
- Proper schema relationships
- Better search engine parsing
- Reduced redundancy

---

## Schema Linking with @id

Schemas reference each other using `@id` properties for proper relationship establishment:

**Organization Reference:**
```json
{
  "@type": "Organization",
  "@id": "https://www.pgclosets.com#organization"
}
```

**Referenced in Website:**
```json
{
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "publisher": {
    "@id": "https://www.pgclosets.com#organization"
  }
}
```

**Referenced in Product Seller:**
```json
{
  "@type": "Offer",
  "seller": {
    "@type": "LocalBusiness",
    "@id": "https://www.pgclosets.com#business"
  }
}
```

---

## Best Practices Followed

### 1. Proper @context and @type

### 2. Complete Required Properties
- All required properties for each schema type included
- Optional but recommended properties added for richness
- No missing critical fields

### 3. URL Consistency
- All URLs are absolute, not relative
- Consistent domain usage (BUSINESS_INFO.urls.main)
- Proper URL encoding where needed

### 4. Price Formatting
- Prices in proper decimal format (not cents)
- Currency explicitly specified (CAD)
- Price valid until dates included

### 5. Image Requirements
- Multiple images for products
- Image objects with dimensions for logos
- Proper image URLs (absolute paths)

### 6. Ratings and Reviews
- Conditional inclusion (only when data exists)
- Proper rating value ranges (1-5)
- Review count included
- Best/worst rating specified

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies:
1. **Schema Placement**
   - Critical schemas in `<head>` (beforeInteractive)
   - Non-critical schemas can be afterInteractive
   - All current implementations use server-side rendering

2. **Size Management**
   - Schemas are generated at build time
   - No runtime schema generation overhead
   - Minimal JSON payload (typically < 5KB per page)

3. **Caching**
   - Static schemas cached at build time
   - Dynamic product data regenerated on ISR schedule
   - No client-side schema generation

---

## Compliance and Standards

### Schema.org Compliance:
- ✅ All schemas follow Schema.org 15.0 specifications
- ✅ Proper nesting of schema types
- ✅ Correct property names and types
- ✅ Valid enumeration values

### Google Guidelines:
- ✅ Follows Google's Structured Data Guidelines
- ✅ No hidden content in schemas
- ✅ Accurate representation of page content
- ✅ No misleading information
