### Title Examples (Bad)

‚ùå "The Ultimate Complete Comprehensive Guide to Everything About Closet Doors for Your Home" (too long, keyword stuffing)
‚ùå "You Won't BELIEVE What Happens Next! üò±" (clickbait, no keywords)

### Title Testing
- [ ] **Read aloud** (does it sound natural?)
- [ ] **Mobile preview checked** (visible on small screens?)
