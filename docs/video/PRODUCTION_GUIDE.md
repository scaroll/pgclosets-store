## Pre-Production

### 1. Planning Phase

#### Content Strategy
- **Objective**: What is the video's purpose? (educate, showcase, testimonial, brand)
- **Audience**: Who is the target viewer? (homeowners, contractors, designers)
- **Message**: What is the core takeaway?
- **CTA**: What action should viewers take?
- **Distribution**: Where will the video be published? (YouTube, website, social)

#### Script Development

**Structure**:
```
[0-5s] HOOK: Grab attention immediately
- Ask a question
- Show dramatic visual
- State a compelling benefit

[5-10% of video] INTRODUCTION: Set expectations
- Who you are
- What viewers will learn
- Why it matters

[Middle 70-80%] CONTENT: Deliver value
- Step-by-step instructions
- Feature demonstrations
- Customer stories
- Clear, organized information

[Final 10-15%] RECAP & CTA: Drive action
- Summarize key points
- Clear call-to-action
- Contact information
- Next steps
```

**Scripting Best Practices**:
- Write for the ear, not the eye (conversational tone)
- Short sentences and simple words
- Include natural pauses for pacing
- Mark B-roll opportunities in script
- Time your script (aim for 125-150 words per minute)
- Read aloud to test flow

#### Storyboarding

Create visual representations of each shot:
- Sketch or describe each scene
- Note camera angles and movements
- Identify required props and locations
- Plan transitions between scenes
- Mark graphic overlays or text

**Storyboard Template**:
```
Shot #: ___
Duration: ___
Camera angle: (wide / medium / close-up / extreme close-up)
Description: ___
Audio/VO: ___
Graphics: ___
Notes: ___
```

#### Shot List

Detailed breakdown of every shot needed:
```
☐ Shot 1: Wide establishing shot of showroom (10s)

## Production

### 2. Filming Day

#### Setup Workflow

**Arrival (30 minutes before shoot)**:
1. Scout location for best angles and lighting
2. Set up tripod and camera at first position
3. Configure lighting setup
4. Test audio levels
5. Do test shots for exposure and focus
6. Brief talent on process and expectations

#### Camera Settings

**Recommended Settings**:
- **Resolution**: 1080p minimum, 4K preferred
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps (standard), 60fps (slow motion), 24fps (cinematic)
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/60 for 30fps, 1/120 for 60fps
- **ISO**: As low as possible (100-400), max 1600
- **White Balance**: Match lighting (5600K daylight, 3200K tungsten)
- **Picture Profile**: Flat/Log for color grading flexibility

**Focus**:
- Use manual focus for critical shots
- Set focus peaking if available
- Focus on eyes for interviews
- Rack focus for dramatic effect

**Exposure**:
- Expose for highlights (don't blow out)
- Use zebras or histogram to check exposure
- Slightly underexpose if uncertain (easier to brighten in post)

#### Lighting Setup

**Three-Point Lighting** (Standard interview setup):

1. **Key Light** (Main light):
   - Positioned 45° to side of subject
   - Slightly above eye level
   - Brightest light source
   - Creates primary illumination and depth

2. **Fill Light** (Shadow softener):
   - Opposite side of key light
   - Lower intensity (50% of key)
   - Reduces harsh shadows
   - Creates more flattering look

3. **Back Light** (Separation):
   - Behind subject, aimed at hair/shoulders
   - Creates separation from background
   - Adds dimension and depth
   - Helps subject "pop"

**Product Lighting**:
- Soft, diffused lighting to minimize harsh shadows
- Use reflectors to bounce light into dark areas
- Backlight transparent/translucent products
- Light from multiple angles to show texture and detail

**Natural Light Tips**:
- Shoot near large windows for soft, flattering light
- Use sheer curtains as diffusion
- Avoid direct sunlight (too harsh)
- Shoot during "golden hour" (early morning/late afternoon) for outdoor scenes
- Use reflectors to fill in shadows

#### Audio Recording

**Microphone Selection**:
- **Shotgun mic**: For general filming, interviews
- **Lavalier (lav) mic**: For interviews, testimonials (hidden on clothing)
- **Handheld mic**: For stand-up presentations, narration

**Audio Best Practices**:
- Record test audio before filming
- Monitor levels throughout shoot (aim for -12dB to -6dB)
- Record 30 seconds of room tone (ambient sound) for editing
- Use windscreen for outdoor recording
- Get mic close to subject (3-6 feet for shotgun, 6-12 inches for lav)
- Always record backup audio if possible

**Troubleshooting Audio**:
- Hum or buzz: Check for electrical interference, ground loops
- Too quiet: Move mic closer, increase gain
- Distortion: Reduce gain, move mic further away
- Echo: Add sound absorption (blankets, foam)

#### Filming Techniques

**Camera Movement**:
- **Static (locked-down)**: For interviews, demonstrations
- **Pan**: Horizontal camera rotation (use for reveals)
- **Tilt**: Vertical camera rotation (building shots)
- **Dolly/Slider**: Physical camera movement toward/away from subject (adds production value)
- **Handheld**: Dynamic, energetic (use stabilization)

**Shot Types**:
- **Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)**: Establishing shot, shows full environment
- **Wide Shot (WS)**: Subject in full, includes context
- **Medium Shot (MS)**: Waist up, conversational
- **Close-Up (CU)**: Shoulders up, intimate, emotional
- **Extreme Close-Up (ECU)**: Details, texture, product features

**Composition Rules**:
- **Rule of Thirds**: Place subject on intersecting lines, not center
- **Headroom**: Leave appropriate space above subject's head
- **Lead Room**: Leave space in direction subject is looking/moving
- **Eye Line**: Position camera at subject's eye level (or intentionally above/below)
- **Background**: Keep background simple, not distracting

**B-Roll Capture** (Essential for editing):
- Shoot 2-3x more B-roll than you think you need
- Vary shot types (wide, medium, close-up)
- Capture different angles of same subject
- Film ambient actions and environments
- Record establishing shots of location
- Get detail shots of products, hardware, textures

#### Production Checklist

**Every Shot**:
- [ ] Frame and composition correct
- [ ] Focus sharp
- [ ] Exposure correct (check highlights and shadows)
- [ ] Audio levels good (-12dB to -6dB)
- [ ] No unwanted noise or distractions
- [ ] Record at least 3 takes

**Throughout Day**:
- [ ] Review footage periodically
- [ ] Check audio sync
- [ ] Maintain continuity (wardrobe, props, lighting)
- [ ] Back up footage to second card/drive
- [ ] Keep shot list updated with completed shots

**Before Wrapping**:
- [ ] Confirm all shots from shot list captured
- [ ] Extra B-roll filmed
- [ ] Room tone recorded
- [ ] Talent releases signed
- [ ] Pack up equipment carefully
- [ ] Leave location as you found it

## Post-Production

### 3. Editing Workflow

#### Step 1: Organization (15 minutes)

**File Structure**:
```
Project_Name/
├── 01_RAW_FOOTAGE/
│   ├── Camera_A/
│   ├── Camera_B/
│   └── Audio/
├── 02_ASSETS/
│   ├── Graphics/
│   ├── Music/
│   ├── Sound_FX/
│   └── Logos/
├── 03_EDIT/
│   ├── Project_Files/
│   ├── Exports/
│   └── Versions/
├── 04_DELIVERABLES/
│   ├── Final/
│   └── Social/
└── PROJECT_BRIEF.txt
```

**Importing and Sorting**:
- Import all footage and audio
- Create bins/folders by scene or camera
- Label clips clearly
- Tag best takes
- Sync audio and video
- Create proxies for 4K footage (if needed for performance)

#### Step 2: Rough Cut (1-2 hours for 3min video)

**Assembly**:
1. Create timeline with script/storyboard as guide
2. Place all A-roll (main footage) on timeline
3. Cut out mistakes, pauses, "ums"
4. Trim to best takes
5. Ensure story flows logically
6. Check for pacing (not too fast or slow)

**Timing Check**:
- Review video length against target
- Identify sections to trim if over length
- Ensure intro hooks viewer in first 5 seconds
- Verify CTA is clear and compelling

#### Step 3: Fine Cut (2-3 hours)

**B-Roll Integration**:
- Add B-roll over interviews/voiceover
- Use B-roll to cover jump cuts
- Ensure B-roll matches narration
- Vary shot types for visual interest
- Use smooth transitions (cuts, dissolves)

**Pacing and Rhythm**:
- Cut to the beat of music (if present)
- Vary shot lengths (not all same duration)
- Build energy toward climax
- Slow down for important information
- Quick cuts for energy, longer shots for emotion

**Transitions**:
- **Cuts**: Default transition, instant
- **Cross-dissolve**: Gentle, indicates time passage
- **Fade to black**: End of section or dramatic pause
- **Wipes/Zooms**: Sparingly, can feel dated

#### Step 4: Color Correction & Grading (30-60 minutes)

**Color Correction** (Making it look natural):
1. Set white balance (make whites actually white)
2. Adjust exposure (not too bright or dark)
3. Match clips from same scene (consistent look)
4. Fix color casts (remove unwanted tints)

**Color Grading** (Creative look):
1. Choose color palette (warm, cool, desaturated, etc.)
2. Apply LUT or preset as starting point
3. Adjust to match brand guidelines
4. Ensure skin tones look natural
5. Add vignettes or subtle effects

**PG Closets Color Profile**:
- Slightly warm tone (inviting, homey)
- Rich, saturated colors (premium feel)
- High contrast (dramatic, luxurious)
- Consistent across all videos

#### Step 5: Audio Mixing (30-45 minutes)

**Audio Levels**:
- Dialogue/voiceover: -12dB to -6dB
- Music: -20dB to -15dB (under dialogue), -12dB (standalone)
- Sound effects: -18dB to -12dB
- Peak levels: Never exceed -3dB

**Audio Enhancement**:
1. Remove background noise (use EQ, noise reduction)
2. Normalize audio levels across clips
3. Add compression to even out volume
4. Apply EQ to improve voice clarity (boost 2-5kHz)
5. De-ess harsh "s" sounds

**Music Selection**:
- Royalty-free music only (Epidemic Sound, Artlist, AudioJungle)
- Match music mood to video tone
- Fade in/out music smoothly
- Duck music under dialogue (auto-ducking)
- Avoid music with distracting lyrics (unless intentional)

**Sound Effects**:
- Add subtle SFX for transitions, graphics
- "Whoosh" for text/logo animations
- Door sounds for door demos
- Ambient sounds for realism

#### Step 6: Graphics & Text (30-45 minutes)

**Lower Thirds** (Name/title overlays):
- Appear in bottom third of screen
- Use PG Closets brand fonts and colors
- Animate in/out smoothly
- Display for 3-5 seconds minimum

**Title Cards**:
- Intro title: Brand name, video title

## Troubleshooting

### 8. Common Issues & Solutions

#### Video Issues

**Problem: Footage looks blurry or soft**
- **Cause**: Out of focus, incorrect shutter speed, dirty lens
- **Solution**: Always check focus on larger screen, clean lens before shooting, use correct shutter speed (1/60 for 30fps)

**Problem: Video looks too dark**
- **Cause**: Underexposed, incorrect ISO, insufficient lighting
- **Solution**: Increase ISO (watch for noise), add more lights, open aperture, use histogram to check exposure

**Problem: Video looks washed out or overexposed**
- **Cause**: Too much light, incorrect white balance, wrong picture profile
- **Solution**: Reduce ISO, close down aperture, add ND filter, adjust lighting, check histogram

**Problem: Shaky footage**
- **Cause**: Handheld without stabilization, unstable tripod
- **Solution**: Use tripod or gimbal, enable in-camera stabilization, post-stabilization in editing software

**Problem: Color doesn't match between shots**
- **Cause**: Different lighting conditions, auto white balance
- **Solution**: Set custom white balance for each location, use manual settings, color correct in post

#### Audio Issues

**Problem: Audio has hum or buzz**
- **Cause**: Electrical interference, ground loop, bad cable
- **Solution**: Move away from electrical sources, use balanced cables, isolate ground loop, use hum removal plugin

**Problem: Echo or reverb**
- **Cause**: Hard surfaces reflecting sound
- **Solution**: Add sound absorption (blankets, foam), get mic closer to subject, record in smaller room

**Problem: Wind noise**
- **Cause**: Wind hitting microphone
- **Solution**: Use windscreen/dead cat, shield mic from wind, reduce low frequencies in post

**Problem: Audio too quiet**
- **Cause**: Mic too far away, gain too low
- **Solution**: Move mic closer, increase gain (watch for distortion), normalize in post-production

**Problem: Inconsistent audio levels**
- **Cause**: Subject moving closer/farther from mic, different recording settings
- **Solution**: Use compression to even out levels, normalize clips, keep subject at consistent distance

#### Editing Issues

**Problem: Video playback is choppy/laggy**
- **Cause**: Computer not powerful enough for 4K, too many effects
- **Solution**: Create proxy files, close other programs, reduce preview quality, upgrade hardware

**Problem: Audio and video out of sync**
- **Cause**: Dropped frames, incorrect import settings
- **Solution**: Re-import correctly, sync manually using waveforms, use clapperboard for reference

**Problem: Exported video quality is poor**
- **Cause**: Low export bitrate, wrong codec, compression artifacts
- **Solution**: Increase bitrate, use H.264 codec, check export settings, export at source resolution

**Problem: Colors look different after export**
- **Cause**: Incorrect color space, different viewing device
- **Solution**: Export in Rec. 709 color space, view on calibrated monitor, test on multiple devices
