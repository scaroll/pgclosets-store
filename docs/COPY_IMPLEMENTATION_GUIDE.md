✅ "Lifetime warranty on all workmanship" (clear, confident)

### DON'T Use

## Quick Quality Checks

Before publishing any copy, verify:

✅ **Brand Voice**: Sophisticated but approachable?
✅ **Benefit-Focused**: Every feature tied to user benefit?
✅ **Specific**: Numbers, names, places (not generic)?
✅ **Local**: Ottawa/NCR references where natural?
✅ **Clear CTAs**: Obvious next step with benefit?
✅ **Credible**: Verifiable claims, honest language?
✅ **Readable**: Grade 8 level, scannable, concise?
✅ **Emotional**: Connect with aspiration/desire?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Generic Benefits
"We provide quality products and great service"

✅ Fix: Specific, verifiable claims
"Official Renin dealer offering lifetime workmanship warranty
on 500+ Ottawa installations"

### ❌ Mistake #2: Feature Dumping
"Our barn doors feature premium hardware, multiple finish options,
soft-close mechanisms, and professional installation available"

✅ Fix: Benefits with context
"Barn doors that glide silently, look stunning, and work flawlessly—
backed by our lifetime warranty. Available in 20+ finishes to
match your exact aesthetic."

### ❌ Mistake #3: Pushy Language
"Don't miss out! Limited time offer! Act now!!!"

✅ Fix: Confident, no-pressure tone
"Ready when you are. Book a free consultation or get your
instant estimate—zero obligation."

### ❌ Mistake #4: Jargon/Technical Speak
"Our proprietary mounting system utilizes advanced fastening
mechanisms for optimal load distribution"

✅ Fix: Plain language with benefit
"We mount hardware directly to studs—never just drywall—
so your doors stay secure for decades."

### ❌ Mistake #5: Vague CTAs
"Learn More" | "Click Here" | "Submit"

✅ Fix: Specific, benefit-driven CTAs
"Get Instant Estimate" | "Book Free Measure" | "Send My Request →"
