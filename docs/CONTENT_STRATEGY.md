[Before/After Case Studies]

Case Study 1: The Big Box Disaster Rescue
"We bought barn doors from [Big Box Store] and paid $200 for installation.
They sent an unlicensed handyman who mounted the hardware incorrectly—
the doors stuck and scratched our walls. PG came in, fixed everything,
and charged us fairly for doing it right. Wish we'd called them first."
— Michael R., Kanata

Case Study 2: The Online Order Nightmare
"Ordered custom bifolds online. They arrived the wrong size and customer
service was impossible. PG measured properly, ordered correctly, and
installed perfectly. The difference between amateur hour and professional
service is night and day."
— Lisa T., Barrhaven

Case Study 3: First Time Right
"Didn't want to deal with big box hassles so we called PG from the start.
Best decision. They guided us through options, measured precisely, and
our barn doors have worked flawlessly for 2 years. Worth every penny."
— David & Emma K., Orleans

H1: Everything You Wanted to Ask
Subheadline: Honest answers to real questions from 500+ Ottawa homeowners.
No jargon, no runaround, just straight talk.

Body: We've guided hundreds of people through this decision. These are the
questions we hear most—answered with the same honesty we'd use with family.

Don't see your question? Call (613) 701-6393 or email info@pgclosets.com.
We love talking about doors (yes, really).
```

**Question Categories**

### Category 1: Choosing the Right Doors

**Q: How do I know which door type is right for my space?**
A: Three factors matter most:

1. **Available space**: Barn doors need wall space beside the opening. Bypass doors work in tight quarters. Bifolds need clearance in front.

2. **Usage frequency**: Daily-use closets benefit from bypass or bifold. Statement spaces suit barn doors.

3. **Aesthetic**: Barn doors make bold statements. Bypass doors suit modern minimalism. Bifolds offer classic versatility.

Still unsure? That's what our free consultation is for. We've seen hundreds of Ottawa homes and can guide you in 10 minutes.

**Q: Can I see samples before deciding?**
A: Absolutely. We bring finish samples to your free in-home measure appointment. You'll see and feel the actual materials—no guessing from tiny online swatches.

For barn doors, we also show hardware options so you understand how they'll look on your wall.

**Q: Do I need custom sizes or will standard work?**
A: Most Ottawa closets accept standard sizes (30", 36", 42", 48" widths). We measure precisely to confirm.

If your opening is non-standard, custom sizing is available. We'll discuss options and pricing during your measure.

---

### Category 2: Pricing & Value

**Q: How much should I expect to pay?**
A: Here are honest Ottawa-installed price ranges:

- **Barn Doors**: $XXX-XXX (single door, standard finishes)
- **Bypass Doors**: $XXX-XXX (two-panel system, standard finishes)
- **Bifold Doors**: $XXX-XXX (standard size, basic finish)
- **French Doors**: $XXX-XXX (pair, standard styles)

These include door, hardware, and professional installation. Custom finishes, sizes, and premium hardware cost more.

Use our Instant Estimator to see your exact price in 60 seconds.

**Q: Why are your prices higher than big box stores?**
A: Three reasons:

1. **Product quality**: We're official Renin dealers. You're getting premium Canadian-made doors, not imported economy products.

2. **Installation expertise**: Our certified installers average 10+ years experience. Big box stores subcontract to whoever's cheapest that week.

3. **Lifetime warranty**: We guarantee our installation forever. Box stores offer 90 days if you're lucky.

The real question: What's the cost of redoing it when cheap fails?

**Q: Do you offer financing?**
A: Not currently, but most projects cost less than expected. Use our Instant Estimator to see your exact price—you might be surprised.

### Category 3: Installation Process

**Q: How long from order to installation?**
A: Our typical timeline:

- **Day 1**: Free measure appointment (30 minutes)
- **Day 2-3**: You receive detailed quote
- **Day 5-7**: You approve and we order materials
- **Week 2-3**: Doors arrive and we schedule installation
- **Install day**: 2-4 hours depending on project size

Total: 2-3 weeks from initial measure to complete installation.

Rush service available for urgent projects (additional fees apply).

**Q: How long does installation take?**
A: Depends on scope:

- Single barn door: 2-3 hours
- Bypass door system: 3-4 hours
- Multiple doors: 4-8 hours
- Custom modifications: May require two visits

We'll give you exact timeline when we measure your space.

**Q: Will installation damage my walls?**
A: Professional installation requires mounting hardware, which means small holes for screws/anchors.

For barn doors, we install a track above your opening (visible hardware is part of the aesthetic).

For bypass/bifold, hardware is concealed inside the frame.

We never cut corners (literally). All mounting is done properly to ensure lifetime reliability.

**Q: Do I need to be home during installation?**
A: Yes. We need access to your space and may have questions about finish placement or hardware details.

Most homeowners enjoy watching the transformation—it's the fun part.

---

### Category 4: Product Quality & Warranty

**Q: What does "Official Renin Dealer" mean?**
A: Three things:

1. **Genuine products**: We source directly from Renin's factory, never through distributors or grey markets.

2. **Full warranties**: Both Renin's manufacturer warranty and our lifetime installation warranty apply.

3. **Priority support**: Access to Renin's technical team if issues ever arise.

Many retailers sell "Renin-style" doors. We sell actual Renin doors.

**Q: What's covered by your lifetime warranty?**
A: Our workmanship—forever:

✅ Hardware mounting failures
✅ Track alignment issues
✅ Installation defects of any kind
✅ Adjustment needs over time

❌ Normal wear and tear (rollers eventually wear)
❌ Damage from misuse or accidents
❌ Issues caused by home settling (but we'll fix for reasonable fee)

Renin's manufacturer warranty covers product defects separately.

**Q: What if something goes wrong after installation?**
A: Call us immediately. We're Ottawa-based and accountable.

Minor adjustments: We'll walk you through fixes over the phone.
Significant issues: We return and make it right—free under our warranty.

Average response time: Same-day call back, repair visit within 48 hours.

---

### Category 5: Service Area & Logistics

**Q: Do you serve my area?**
A: Free in-home measures within 30km of downtown Ottawa:

✅ Kanata, Stittsville, Carp
✅ Barrhaven, Riverside South
✅ Orleans, Cumberland
✅ Centretown, Glebe, Westboro
✅ Nepean, Bells Corners
✅ Gatineau (select areas)

A: Measures: Monday-Saturday, 9am-6pm
Installations: Monday-Saturday, 8am-6pm
Sunday: By special request only

We respect your time and are always punctual.

---

### Category 6: Specific Door Types

**Q: Will barn doors provide privacy?**
A: Barn doors slide in front of your opening but don't seal like traditional doors.

Privacy concerns:
- **Visual privacy**: Complete when closed
- **Sound privacy**: Minimal (not suitable for bathrooms)
- **Light blocking**: Some light leaks around edges

For bedrooms and walk-in closets: Perfect
For main bathrooms: Consider French doors instead

**Q: Can I install a barn door myself?**
A: Technically yes, but we don't recommend it.

Barn door installation requires:
- Locating studs precisely
- Installing track perfectly level
- Calculating proper door overlap
- Mounting hardware that holds 100+ lbs

Amateur installation is the #1 cause of barn door failures: sticking, scraping, falling off tracks.

Our installation costs $XXX-XXX and includes lifetime warranty.
Is $XXX-XXX worth avoiding a disaster? Most say yes.

**Q: How do I clean and maintain my doors?**
A: Renin doors are low-maintenance:

**Regular cleaning**:
- Wipe with damp microfiber cloth
- Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasives
- For glass panels, use standard glass cleaner

**Hardware maintenance**:
- Vacuum track/rails monthly
- Wipe rollers with dry cloth quarterly
- Soft-close mechanisms need no maintenance

**Long-term care**:
- Painted finishes may need touch-ups after 10-15 years
- Rollers may need replacement after 15-20 years (we handle this)

Treat your doors with basic care and they'll last 30+ years.

## Final Notes

**Remember the North Star**:
"Elevated taste without pretense"

Every word, every headline, every call-to-action should embody this.

We're not trying to be the loudest voice in the market.
We're trying to be the most trusted.

The copy should feel like talking to a knowledgeable neighbor who happens
to be an expert in closet doors—confident, helpful, genuine, and never
trying too hard.

When in doubt, ask: "Would I want to read this? Would I trust the person
who wrote this? Would this help me make a confident decision?"

If the answer is yes to all three, you've got it right.
