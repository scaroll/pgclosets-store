Review the current codebase against Apple design principles:

1. Check for forbidden elements:
   - Carousels/sliders
   - Pop-ups
   - Chat widgets
   - Auto-playing video
   - Excessive animations

2. Verify typography:
   - Is SF Pro Display/Inter being used?
   - Are headlines large enough (80-120px)?
   - Is there proper hierarchy?

3. Check whitespace:
   - Section padding at least 120px?
   - Content max-width under 1200px?
   - Text max-width under 800px?

4. Review color usage:
   - Only one accent color?
   - Proper contrast ratios?

5. Audit copy:
   - No exclamation points?
   - No superlatives (best, premier, finest)?
   - Short sentences, fragments OK?

Report findings as a checklist with pass/fail for each item.
