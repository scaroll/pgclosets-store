2. Click "Sign Up" (free tier is sufficient)
3. Create account with your email address
4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Add Domain
1. Log into ImprovMX dashboard: https://app.improvmx.com
2. Click "+ Add Domain"
3. Enter: `pgclosets.com`

### Step 4: Verify Configuration
After adding the catch-all alias, the ImprovMX dashboard should show:
- ‚úÖ Domain: pgclosets.com

## üß™ Testing Instructions

Once ImprovMX is configured, test the forwarding:

### Test 1: Send to info@pgclosets.com
```bash
# From your personal email, send to: info@pgclosets.com
# Check that spencer@peoplesgrp.com receives it
```

### Test 2: Send to sales@pgclosets.com
```bash
# From your personal email, send to: sales@pgclosets.com
# Check that spencer@peoplesgrp.com receives it
```

### Test 3: Send to random@pgclosets.com
```bash
# From your personal email, send to: randomtestaddress@pgclosets.com
# Check that spencer@peoplesgrp.com receives it
```

### Test 4: Check Email Headers
When you receive the forwarded emails at spencer@peoplesgrp.com:
- Open email ‚Üí View headers
- Verify `X-Forwarded-By: ImprovMX` is present
- Verify `From:` shows original sender
- Verify no other recipients received copies

## üìä DNS Propagation Verification

Run these commands to verify DNS records are live:

```bash
# Check MX records
dig MX pgclosets.com +short

# Expected output:
# 10 mx1.improvmx.com.
# 20 mx2.improvmx.com.

# Check SPF record
dig TXT pgclosets.com +short

# Expected output:
# "v=spf1 include:spf.improvmx.com ~all"

# Check DMARC record
dig TXT _dmarc.pgclosets.com +short

# Expected output:
# "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:spencer@peoplesgrp.com"
```

**DNS Propagation Time**: 5-15 minutes typically, up to 48 hours maximum

## üìã Current Configuration Summary

### Before
- ‚ùå No email configured
- ‚ùå No MX records
- ‚ùå No SPF/DMARC records
- ‚ùå No mailboxes or forwarding

### After DNS Setup (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ MX records pointing to ImprovMX
- ‚úÖ SPF record authorizing ImprovMX
- ‚úÖ DMARC record with reporting to spencer@peoplesgrp.com
- ‚è≥ ImprovMX account setup (requires manual step)

### After ImprovMX Setup (PENDING)
- ‚úÖ Catch-all alias: `*@pgclosets.com` ‚Üí `spencer@peoplesgrp.com`
- ‚úÖ All email addresses forward to single destination
- ‚úÖ No other mailboxes exist
- ‚úÖ No other recipients configured

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
- ‚úÖ Configured to authorize ImprovMX servers
- ‚úÖ Soft fail (~all) to prevent delivery issues during transition

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)
- ‚úÖ Policy: `p=none` (monitor mode)
- ‚úÖ Reports sent to: spencer@peoplesgrp.com
- üí° **Recommendation**: After 30 days of monitoring, upgrade to `p=quarantine` or `p=reject`

### Email Forwarding Security
- ‚úÖ ImprovMX uses TLS encryption
- ‚úÖ SPF/DKIM preserved from original sender
- ‚úÖ No email storage (immediate forwarding only)

---

## üìà Monitoring & Maintenance

### DMARC Reports
- Check spencer@peoplesgrp.com for weekly DMARC reports
- Reports show email authentication success/failure rates
- Use to identify unauthorized use of pgclosets.com domain

### ImprovMX Dashboard
- Monitor forwarding logs: https://app.improvmx.com
- Free tier includes basic logs and statistics
- Check for delivery failures or bounces

### DNS Records
- MX, SPF, DMARC records are permanent
- No regular maintenance required unless changing email provider

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Forwarding
1. Check ImprovMX dashboard for domain status
2. Verify catch-all alias is active: `*@pgclosets.com`
3. Check spam folder at spencer@peoplesgrp.com
4. Review ImprovMX logs for delivery errors

### DNS Not Resolving
```bash
# Flush local DNS cache (macOS)
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

# Check propagation at multiple locations
dig MX pgclosets.com @8.8.8.8 +short  # Google DNS
dig MX pgclosets.com @1.1.1.1 +short  # Cloudflare DNS
```

### Delivery Failures
1. Check sender's SPF/DKIM alignment
2. Verify spencer@peoplesgrp.com mailbox isn't full
3. Check spencer@peoplesgrp.com spam filters
4. Review DMARC reports for authentication issues
