## Incident Response Phases

### Phase 1: DETECTION

#### Detection Methods
1. **Automated Monitoring**
   - Security event logs (`lib/security/monitoring.ts`)
   - Anomaly detection alerts
   - Intrusion detection system (IDS)
   - Application performance monitoring (APM)

2. **Manual Detection**
   - User reports
   - Customer complaints
   - Security audit findings
   - Penetration test results

#### Initial Detection Actions
```bash
# 1. Verify the alert
# Check security logs
tail -f /var/log/security-events.log

# 2. Assess severity
# Run security dashboard
npm run security:dashboard

# 3. Create incident ticket
# Document initial findings
```

---

### Phase 2: CONTAINMENT

#### Short-term Containment (< 1 hour)

**Objectives:**
- Stop the attack/breach
- Prevent further damage
- Preserve evidence

**Actions:**

1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
```bash
# Block compromised IP addresses
node -e "require('./lib/security/monitoring').ThreatDetection.blockIP('x.x.x.x', 'Active attack')"

# Disable compromised user accounts
node -e "require('./lib/security/monitoring').ThreatDetection.blockUser('user-id', 'Account compromise')"
```

2. **Enable Enhanced Logging**
```typescript
// Increase log verbosity
process.env.VERBOSE_LOGGING = 'true'
process.env.SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL = 'debug'
```

3. **Snapshot Current State**
```bash
# Capture system state for forensics
docker exec -it app npm run security:snapshot
git commit -am "Emergency snapshot before remediation"
```

#### Long-term Containment (1-24 hours)

**Objectives:**
- Implement temporary fixes
- Restore critical services
- Maintain evidence

**Actions:**

1. **Deploy Emergency Patches**
```bash
# Apply security hotfixes
git checkout -b security/hotfix-$(date +%s)
# Make necessary changes
git commit -m "Security hotfix: [description]"
git push origin HEAD
```

2. **Implement Workarounds**
```typescript
// Example: Disable affected feature temporarily
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  AFFECTED_FEATURE: false, // Disabled due to incident INC-2025-001
}
```

3. **Enhance Monitoring**
```typescript
// Add specific monitoring for attack vector
SecurityMonitor.log({
  type: 'SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY',
  severity: 'high',
  // ... detailed monitoring
})
```

---

### Phase 3: ERADICATION

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Investigation Steps:**

1. **Log Analysis**
```bash
# Search security logs for attack patterns
grep "SQL_INJECTION_ATTEMPT" /var/log/security-events.log

# Analyze authentication failures
npm run security:analyze --type LOGIN_FAILED --since "2025-01-01"
```

2. **System Examination**
```bash
# Check for unauthorized changes
git diff production HEAD

# Review database changes
npm run db:audit --since "2025-01-01"
```

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
```bash
# Run security scan
npm audit
npm run security:scan
```

#### Remediation Actions

1. **Remove Malicious Content**
```bash
# Remove backdoors, malware, or unauthorized code
git revert <malicious-commit>
npm run security:cleanup
```

2. **Patch Vulnerabilities**
```bash
# Update vulnerable dependencies
npm update
npm audit fix --force
```

3. **Strengthen Security Controls**
```typescript
// Example: Enforce stricter input validation
import { sanitizeObject, sanitizationPresets } from '@/lib/validation/sanitization'

const sanitized = sanitizeObject(userInput, sanitizationPresets.strict)
```

---

### Phase 4: RECOVERY

#### System Restoration

**Recovery Checklist:**

- [ ] Verify all malicious content removed
- [ ] Confirm vulnerabilities patched
- [ ] Test system functionality
- [ ] Monitor for recurring issues
- [ ] Validate data integrity
- [ ] Restore from clean backup if necessary

**Recovery Steps:**

1. **Staged Rollout**
```bash
# 1. Test in staging
vercel deploy --env=staging

# 2. Canary deployment (10% traffic)
vercel deploy --prod --target=canary

# 3. Full production deployment
vercel deploy --prod
```

2. **Continuous Monitoring**
```typescript
// Enhanced monitoring during recovery
const RECOVERY_MODE = true
const MONITORING_INTERVAL = 60000 // 1 minute instead of 5

setInterval(() => {
  SecurityMonitor.getDashboard()
}, MONITORING_INTERVAL)
```

3. **User Communication**
```typescript
// Notify affected users
const notificationTemplate = {
  subject: 'Security Incident Resolution',
  body: `

Actions taken:
- [List actions]

What you should do:
