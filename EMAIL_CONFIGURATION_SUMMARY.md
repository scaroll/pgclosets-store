## 1. Current DNS Configuration

### 1.1 MX Records (Mail Exchange)
```
Priority  Hostname              Record ID
10        mx1.improvmx.com      rec_294bce2737d616bc4e04cb3b
20        mx2.improvmx.com      rec_a2efff1d9f8864e268a698ee
```

**Purpose**: Routes all email for @pgclosets.com to ImprovMX mail servers
**Verification**: ✅ Propagated globally (Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS confirmed)

### 1.2 SPF Record (Sender Policy Framework)
```
Record Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:spf.improvmx.com ~all
Record ID: rec_3c8ad0dda42738019696c60e
```

**Purpose**: Authorizes ImprovMX servers to send email on behalf of pgclosets.com

## 4. ImprovMX Setup Instructions

### 4.1 Account Creation
1. Visit: https://improvmx.com
2. Click "Sign Up" (top right)
3. Enter email address (suggest: spencer@peoplesgrp.com)
4. Create password
5. Verify email address via confirmation link
6. **No credit card required** - free tier is fully featured

### 4.2 Domain Addition
1. Log into dashboard: https://app.improvmx.com
2. Click "+ Add Domain"
3. Enter: `pgclosets.com`
4. ImprovMX will auto-detect our MX records
5. Status should show: ✅ **MX records found**
6. Click "Add Domain"

### 4.3 Catch-All Alias Configuration
1. Select pgclosets.com from domain list
2. Navigate to "Aliases" tab
3. Click "+ Add Alias"
4. Configure:
   ```
   Alias:       *
   Forward to:  spencer@peoplesgrp.com
   ```
5. Click "Add Alias"
6. Verify alias appears as: `*@pgclosets.com` → `spencer@peoplesgrp.com`

**What This Does**:
- `*` = Catch-all (matches ANY email address)
- Every email sent to @pgclosets.com goes to spencer@peoplesgrp.com
- Examples:
  - info@pgclosets.com → spencer@peoplesgrp.com
  - sales@pgclosets.com → spencer@peoplesgrp.com
  - hello@pgclosets.com → spencer@peoplesgrp.com
  - randomtest123@pgclosets.com → spencer@peoplesgrp.com

### 4.4 Optional: Specific Aliases (Alternative to Catch-All)
If you prefer explicit aliases instead of catch-all:
```
info@pgclosets.com    → spencer@peoplesgrp.com
sales@pgclosets.com   → spencer@peoplesgrp.com
support@pgclosets.com → spencer@peoplesgrp.com
hello@pgclosets.com   → spencer@peoplesgrp.com
```

**Recommendation**: Use catch-all (`*`) to ensure no emails are missed.

## 5. Testing & Verification

### 5.1 Test Plan
Once ImprovMX is configured, perform these tests:

**Test 1: Common Addresses**
```
Send emails to:
- info@pgclosets.com
- sales@pgclosets.com
- support@pgclosets.com
- hello@pgclosets.com

Verify all arrive at spencer@peoplesgrp.com
```

**Test 2: Random Addresses**
```
Send emails to:
- randomtest@pgclosets.com
- nonexistent@pgclosets.com
- test12345@pgclosets.com

Verify all arrive at spencer@peoplesgrp.com (catch-all working)
```

**Test 3: Email Header Inspection**
```
Open any forwarded email at spencer@peoplesgrp.com
View email headers
Verify:
- X-Forwarded-By: ImprovMX
- From: [original sender]
- To: [original @pgclosets.com address]
- No other recipients in headers
```

### 5.2 Verification Checklist
- [ ] Test emails sent from external account (Gmail/Outlook)
- [ ] All test emails arrived at spencer@peoplesgrp.com
- [ ] No test emails went to other addresses
- [ ] Email headers show ImprovMX forwarding
- [ ] Original sender preserved in "From" field
- [ ] No emails in spam folder
- [ ] Forwarding delay < 30 seconds

---

## 6. Security & Compliance

### 6.1 SPF Alignment
```
Current: v=spf1 include:spf.improvmx.com ~all
Status: ✅ Configured correctly
```

**What it does**:
- Authorizes ImprovMX servers (mx1/mx2.improvmx.com) to send email
- `~all` = Soft fail for other servers (allows delivery but marks as suspicious)
- Prevents email spoofing of @pgclosets.com addresses

**Recommendation**: Monitor for 30 days, then upgrade to `-all` (hard fail) for stronger protection.

### 6.2 DMARC Policy
```
Current: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:spencer@peoplesgrp.com
Status: ✅ Configured correctly (monitor mode)
```

**What it does**:
- `p=none` = Monitor mode (no enforcement, just reporting)
- `rua=` = Aggregate reports sent weekly to spencer@peoplesgrp.com
- Tracks SPF/DKIM authentication success rates

**Recommendation**: After 30 days of clean reports, upgrade to `p=quarantine` or `p=reject`.

### 6.3 DKIM Signing
**Status**: ⏳ Requires premium ImprovMX plan ($9/month)

**Current Setup**: DKIM not configured (not required for basic forwarding)

**Impact**:
- Forwarded emails preserve original DKIM signature
- pgclosets.com doesn't sign outgoing emails (forwarding only)
- No impact on deliverability for forwarding use case

**Recommendation**: Add DKIM if you need to SEND email as @pgclosets.com (requires SMTP).

### 6.4 TLS Encryption
- ✅ ImprovMX uses TLS 1.2+ for all connections
- ✅ Emails forwarded securely to spencer@peoplesgrp.com
- ✅ No plaintext transmission

---

## 7. Monitoring & Maintenance

### 7.1 ImprovMX Dashboard
**URL**: https://app.improvmx.com

**What to monitor**:
- Forwarding logs (last 30 days on free tier)
- Delivery success rate
- Bounce notifications
- Domain status (should always show "Active")

**Recommended frequency**: Weekly check

### 7.2 DMARC Reports
**Delivery**: Weekly to spencer@peoplesgrp.com
**Format**: XML attachment (can use https://dmarc.postmarkapp.com to parse)

**What to check**:
- SPF pass rate (should be 100%)
- DKIM pass rate (from original senders)
- Unauthorized sending attempts (should be 0)

**Action items**:
- If pass rate < 95%, investigate configuration
- If unauthorized attempts detected, consider stricter DMARC policy

### 7.3 DNS Health
**What to monitor**: MX/SPF/DMARC records remain unchanged

**How to check**:
```bash
# Quick health check
dig MX pgclosets.com +short
dig TXT pgclosets.com +short
dig TXT _dmarc.pgclosets.com +short
```

**Expected output**: (same as section 3.1)

**Alert triggers**:
- MX records missing or changed
- SPF record removed
- DMARC record removed

**Recommended frequency**: Automated monthly check (set up monitoring)

## 8. Troubleshooting

### 8.1 Emails Not Arriving
**Symptoms**: Test emails sent but not received at spencer@peoplesgrp.com

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check spam folder at spencer@peoplesgrp.com
2. Verify ImprovMX domain status is "Active"
3. Verify catch-all alias exists: `*@pgclosets.com`
4. Check ImprovMX forwarding logs for errors
5. Verify spencer@peoplesgrp.com mailbox is not full

**Common causes**:
- Spam filtering at destination
- Typo in forwarding address
- Catch-all alias not configured
- ImprovMX quota exceeded (unlikely on free tier)

### 8.2 DNS Resolution Issues
**Symptoms**: `dig` commands return no results

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Flush DNS cache
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

# Check authoritative nameservers
dig NS pgclosets.com +short

# Query Vercel DNS directly
dig MX pgclosets.com @ns1.vercel-dns.com +short
```

**Common causes**:
- Local DNS cache outdated
- ISP DNS resolver issues
- Propagation delay (wait 15-30 minutes)

### 8.3 Forwarding Delays
**Symptoms**: Emails arrive 5+ minutes late

**Normal latency**: < 30 seconds for ImprovMX forwarding

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check email headers for timestamp differences
2. Review ImprovMX dashboard for queued messages
3. Check destination server (spencer@peoplesgrp.com) for delays

**Common causes**:
- Spam filtering at destination (adds delay)
- Large attachments (slow forwarding)
- Destination mailbox quota issues

---

## 10. Migration Path (If Needed Later)

### 10.1 To Google Workspace
If you later need full mailboxes:

```
Step 1: Create Google Workspace account
Step 2: Update MX records in Vercel DNS:
  - Remove ImprovMX MX records (rec_294bce2737d616bc4e04cb3b, rec_a2efff1d9f8864e268a698ee)
  - Add Google MX records (5 records)
Step 3: Update SPF record:
  - Change to: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
Step 4: Configure Google Workspace forwarding (if still desired)
Step 5: Delete ImprovMX account
```

**Downtime**: < 5 minutes (during MX record change)
**Cost**: $6/month per user

### 10.2 To SendGrid/Mailgun (Transactional Email)
If you need to SEND automated emails:

```
Keep current setup (ImprovMX for receiving)
Add separate service for sending:
  - SendGrid: 100 emails/day free
  - Mailgun: 100 emails/day free
  - Amazon SES: $0.10 per 1000 emails

No changes to MX records needed (sending uses SMTP, not MX)
```

**Best of both worlds**: Receive via ImprovMX (free), send via SendGrid (free tier)
