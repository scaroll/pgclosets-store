## üìã DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE

### Step 1: Access Vercel Dashboard

1. **Login to Vercel**: https://vercel.com
2. **Navigate to Project**:
   - Organization: `peoples-group`
   - Project: `pgclosets-store`
3. **Go to Deployments Tab**

**Direct Link**:
```
https://vercel.com/peoples-group/pgclosets-store/deployments
```

---

### Step 2: Identify the Deployment to Pin

**Current Production Deployment Info**:
- **Deployment ID**: `iad1::4pltp-1760147304704-725592ffac68`
- **Likely Commit**: `5f007c1` or `ea277ec`
- **Status**: Currently live in production

**Visual Indicators**:
- üü¢ **"Production"** badge (green)
- May show domain: `www.pgclosets.com`
- Most recent successful deployment

**Verify Before Pinning**:
1. Click on the deployment
2. Check **"Commit"** section - shows git commit hash
3. Check **"Build Logs"** - ensure build was successful
4. Check **"Preview"** - test the deployed site
5. Verify this is the version you want to keep stable

---

### Step 3: Pin the Deployment

#### Using Deployment List View

1. **Locate Deployment** in the deployments list
2. **Hover** over the deployment row
3. **Click** the three dots menu (**‚ãÆ**) on the far right
4. **Select** one of these options:
   - **"Promote to Production"** (if not already production)
   - **"Pin to Production"** (if already production)
   - **"Pin Deployment"**
5. **Confirm** when prompted

#### Using Deployment Details View

1. **Click** on the deployment to open details
2. Look for buttons at the top right:
   - **"Promote to Production"** button
   - **"‚ãÆ" menu** for more options
3. **Click** the appropriate button
4. **Check** "Pin this deployment" checkbox (if available)
5. **Confirm** the action

---

### Step 4: Verify Pin Status

**After Pinning, Check For**:

1. **"Pinned" Badge**:
   - Should appear next to "Production" badge
   - May be a pin icon: üìå

2. **Deployment List**:
   - Pinned deployment stays at top
   - New deployments show as "Preview" only

3. **Settings Indicator**:
   - May show "Pinned to production" in deployment details

**Test Auto-Deploy is Disabled**:
```bash
# Make a trivial change
echo "\n# Test after pin" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify pin prevents auto-deploy"
git push origin master

# Check Vercel dashboard
# New deployment should be "Preview" only, NOT "Production"
```

## üîì HOW TO UNPIN (When Ready to Deploy Again)

### Unpinning a Deployment

**When You Want New Changes to Auto-Deploy**:

1. **Go to Deployments**: https://vercel.com/peoples-group/pgclosets-store/deployments
2. **Find Pinned Deployment** (has "Pinned" badge)
3. **Click** three dots menu (**‚ãÆ**)
4. **Select** "Unpin from Production" or "Unpin Deployment"
5. **Confirm**

**After Unpinning**:
- Latest successful deployment becomes production
- Auto-deploy resumes for new pushes
- No "Pinned" badge visible

---

## üìå WHAT PINNING DOES

### When Deployment is Pinned ‚úÖ

**Production Deployment**:
- ‚úÖ Stays locked to specific git commit
- ‚úÖ Will NOT change even when new code is pushed
- ‚úÖ Stable and predictable

**New Pushes to Master**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Create "Preview" deployments only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT become production automatically
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must be manually promoted to production

**Benefits**:
- üîí Production stability guaranteed
- üß™ Test new changes in preview first
- üéØ Control exactly when updates go live
- üõ°Ô∏è Prevent accidental production updates

---

### When Deployment is NOT Pinned

**Production Deployment**:
- üîÑ Updates automatically with every push to master
- üöÄ Latest commit goes live immediately
- ‚ö° Fast iteration, but less control

**New Pushes to Master**:
- ‚úÖ Trigger automatic production deployment
- ‚úÖ Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Live (all automatic)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires confidence in CI/CD pipeline

---

## üéØ WHEN TO PIN

### Good Reasons to Pin

**1. Major Event or High Traffic**:
- Black Friday sales
- Product launch
- Marketing campaign
- Prevents unexpected changes during critical time

**2. Awaiting External Changes**:
- DNS propagation in progress
- Third-party service maintenance
- Coordinating with other teams

**3. Testing Phase**:
- Want to test new features in preview
- Need stakeholder approval before production
- A/B testing different versions

**4. Stability Period**:
- After major refactor, want stability
- Before holiday/vacation (no unattended deployments)
- Regulatory review in progress

---

### When NOT to Pin

**1. Active Development**:
- Rapidly iterating on features
- Continuous deployment workflow
- Team expects immediate updates

**2. Bug Fixes**:
- Critical bug in production
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Need fast patching capability

**3. Ongoing Optimization**:
- Performance improvements rolling out
- SEO updates being deployed
- A/B test variations changing

## ‚öôÔ∏è ALTERNATIVE: Pin via Vercel CLI

### Using Command Line (Advanced)

**Prerequisites**:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Link to project
vercel link
```

**Get Deployment URL**:
```bash
# List recent deployments
vercel ls

# Find the deployment URL you want to pin
# Format: pgclosets-store-abc123xyz.vercel.app
```

**Pin Deployment**:
```bash
# Promote specific deployment to production
vercel promote <deployment-url> --scope peoples-group
```

**Example**:
```bash
vercel promote pgclosets-store-5f007c1.vercel.app --scope peoples-group
```

**Note**: CLI doesn't have explicit "pin" command. Promoting sets it as production, but doesn't prevent future auto-deploys. Dashboard method recommended for true pinning.

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

### Critical Reminders

1. **Pinning Disables Auto-Deploy**:
   - New code pushed to master will NOT go to production
   - Preview deployments still created
   - Must manually promote each update

2. **Team Communication**:
   - Notify team that production is pinned
   - Prevent confusion about why changes aren't live
   - Document expected unpin time

3. **Remember to Unpin**:
   - Set calendar reminder
   - Don't leave pinned indefinitely
   - Resume normal deployment flow when ready

4. **Emergency Override**:
   - Can always manually promote critical fixes
   - Pin doesn't prevent manual deployment
   - Just disables automatic deployment
