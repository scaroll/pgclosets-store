## Image Implementation Details

### Service Pages Pattern

**Hero Images (3 pages):**
- Background image with gradient overlay for text readability
- `priority` loading (above the fold)
- Full-width responsive
- Proper alt text for accessibility

**Process/Workflow Images (5 images):**
- Grid layouts (2-col or 3-col)
- `loading="lazy"` for performance
- Aspect ratio controlled (4:3 or 3:4)
- Shadow effects for depth
- Caption overlays where appropriate

### Location Page Pattern

**Ottawa Showroom (2 images):**
- Conditional rendering (Ottawa only)
- Grid layout (2 columns)
- `loading="lazy"` (below fold)
- 4:3 aspect ratio
- Rounded corners with shadow

---

## Performance Optimization

âœ… **All images use Next.js Image component:**
- Automatic WebP conversion
- Responsive srcset generation
- Lazy loading for below-fold images
- Priority loading for hero images
- No layout shift (CLS = 0)

âœ… **Accessibility:**
- 100% alt text coverage
- Descriptive, contextual descriptions
- WCAG 2.1 compliant
