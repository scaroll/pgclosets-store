## Transcript Optimization for SEO

### Why Transcripts Matter
- YouTube indexes spoken content for search
- Accessibility for deaf/hard of hearing viewers
- Captions improve watch time (viewers on mute)
- Transcripts can be repurposed for blog content
- Google indexes YouTube transcripts for web search

### Transcript Best Practices

#### 1. Review Auto-Generated Captions
YouTube auto-generates captions, but they need manual review:
- **Proper nouns**: Brand names (Renin, PG Closets)
- **Technical terms**: Bypass, bifold, soft-close hardware
- **Location names**: Ottawa, Kanata, Nepean
- **Product names**: Industrial Barn Door, Mirror Door

#### 2. Add Keyword-Rich Descriptions
Include natural mentions of target keywords:
- "In this video, we're looking at bypass closet doors..."
- "If you're searching for closet door options in Ottawa..."
- "Let's compare bifold vs bypass sliding closet doors..."

#### 3. Use Clear Speech Patterns
When recording:
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Enunciate technical terms
- Repeat important keywords naturally
- Use full phrases (not incomplete thoughts)

#### 4. Format for Readability
When publishing transcripts:
```
[Speaker name or role - 0:00]
Clear paragraph structure with proper punctuation.

[Speaker - 0:30]
New topic or section gets new paragraph.

[Visual description if needed - 1:00]
"As you can see on screen, the bypass door track..."
```

#### 5. Repurpose for Blog Content
Turn video transcripts into blog posts:
- Edit for written format (remove filler words)
- Add headings and structure
- Include images/screenshots from video
- Embed video at top of post
- Add internal links to products/services
- Optimize meta description with keywords

### Transcript SEO Checklist
- [ ] Auto-captions reviewed for accuracy
- [ ] Keywords naturally included in speech
- [ ] Technical terms spelled correctly
- [ ] Speaker names/roles identified
- [ ] Timestamps added for major sections
