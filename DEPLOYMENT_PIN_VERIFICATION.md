## üìä DEPLOYMENT PIN ANALYSIS

### What is "Pinned"?

Based on the verification:

1. **Git Repository Pin**: ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**
   - Latest commit: `c6743be`
   - Pushed to GitHub: ‚úÖ YES
   - Branch: `master`
   - All commits synced with origin

2. **Vercel Deployment Pin**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
   - Latest deployment ID shows very recent timestamp (Oct 10, 21:41:58)
   - This is ~26 hours AFTER the latest code commit
   - Suggests deployment may be from an earlier commit OR a redeploy

---

### Possible Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Deployment is Pinned to Earlier Commit
**Evidence**:
- Latest commit is documentation-only (`c6743be`)
- Deployment timestamp is 26 hours later
- Deployment ID doesn't correlate with recent commit time

**Implication**: Vercel may be pinned to an earlier commit (possibly `5f007c1`, `ea277ec`, or earlier)

**To Verify in Vercel Dashboard**:
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/peoples-group/pgclosets-store/deployments
2. Check "Production" deployment
3. Look for "Pinned" badge or icon
4. Check commit hash associated with production deployment

#### Scenario 2: Recent Redeploy of Latest Code
**Evidence**:
- Deployment timestamp is very recent (just minutes ago)
- Could be automatic redeploy or manual trigger

**Implication**: Deployment may be current but timestamp suggests recent activity

#### Scenario 3: Rate Limiting Preventing Accurate Check
**Evidence**:
- HTTP 429 responses
- Multiple verification requests in short time

**Implication**: Cannot accurately verify deployed code version due to rate limiting

## üîß MANUAL VERIFICATION STEPS

Since the site is rate-limited, verify the pin manually in Vercel Dashboard:

### Step 1: Check Production Deployment

1. **Visit Vercel Dashboard**:
   ```
   https://vercel.com/peoples-group/pgclosets-store/deployments
   ```

2. **Look for Production Deployment**:
   - Should show "Production" badge
   - May show "Pinned" indicator if pinned to specific commit

3. **Check Commit Hash**:
   - Click on production deployment
   - Look for "Commit" or "Git Hash"
   - Compare to latest: `c6743be8a6c01e7238dbe734d2dede6c985df51e`

4. **Check Deployment Date**:
   - Compare deployment timestamp
   - Should correlate with commit time if auto-deployed

---

### Step 2: Check if Deployment is Pinned

**In Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments**:

1. Look for **"Pin to Production"** or **"Pinned"** indicator
2. If deployment is pinned:
   - It will show which commit it's pinned to
   - Subsequent pushes won't auto-deploy to production
3. If NOT pinned:
   - Every push to `master` triggers new production deployment
   - Latest deployment should match latest commit

**To Unpin** (if needed):
1. Click on pinned deployment
2. Click "Unpin from Production"
3. Latest deployment will become active

**To Pin** (if needed):
1. Find desired deployment
2. Click "Promote to Production"
3. Check "Pin this deployment"

---

### Step 3: Verify Auto-Deploy Settings

**In Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Git**:

1. **Production Branch**: Should be `master` ‚úÖ
2. **Auto-Deploy**: Should be **ON** ‚úÖ
3. **Preview Deployments**: Should be **ON** for PRs ‚úÖ

If auto-deploy is OFF or production branch is wrong:
- Pushes won't trigger deployments
- Manual deployment or redeploy required

---

### Step 4: Check Deployment Logs

1. Visit latest deployment in dashboard
2. Check "Build Logs"
3. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Build succeeded
   - ‚úÖ Correct commit hash
   - ‚úÖ No errors
   - ‚úÖ 218 routes generated

---

### Step 5: Test When Rate Limit Clears

**Wait 5-10 minutes for rate limit to clear**, then verify:

```bash
# Check deployment ID
curl -sI https://www.pgclosets.com | grep x-vercel-id

# Check ETag (should change with new deployments)
curl -sI https://www.pgclosets.com | grep etag

# Check site responds
curl -s https://www.pgclosets.com | grep -o '<title>[^<]*</title>'
```

**Expected if on latest commit**:
- New deployment ID (different from: `x2fpg-1760146918538-edef719f448b`)
- New ETag
- Site loads correctly

---

## üìã PIN VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Use this checklist in Vercel Dashboard:

### Current Deployment Status
- [ ] Check production deployment commit hash
- [ ] Verify if "Pinned" indicator is shown
- [ ] Compare commit hash to latest: `c6743be`
- [ ] Check deployment timestamp matches commit time

### Auto-Deploy Configuration
- [ ] Production branch set to: `master`
- [ ] Auto-deploy enabled: YES
- [ ] Preview deployments enabled: YES
- [ ] Install command override: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

### Expected Behavior (If NOT Pinned)
- [ ] Latest commit: `c6743be` (Oct 9, 19:02:58)
- [ ] Should auto-deploy when pushed
- [ ] Production should match latest commit
- [ ] No manual intervention needed

### If Pinned (Manual Deployment Required)
- [ ] Note which commit is pinned
- [ ] Decide if unpin needed
- [ ] If unpinning, verify auto-deploy triggers
- [ ] If staying pinned, manual promote when ready

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

Based on rate-limiting preventing full verification:

### Immediate (Now)
1. ‚úÖ **Git Status**: VERIFIED - All commits pushed, working tree clean
2. ‚è≥ **Wait for Rate Limit**: 5-10 minutes before re-checking production

### Short-term (Next 10 minutes)
3. **Check Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Verify production deployment commit
   - Check if pinned
   - Verify auto-deploy settings

4. **When Rate Limit Clears**:
   - Test production site
   - Verify deployment ID
   - Check ETag for freshness

### If Deployment Doesn't Match Latest
5. **Trigger New Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Option A: Trivial commit
   echo "\n# Deployment verification" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "test: verify Vercel deployment pin"
   git push origin master

   # Option B: Manual redeploy in dashboard
   # Visit: https://vercel.com/peoples-group/pgclosets-store/deployments
   # Click latest deployment ‚Üí "Redeploy"
   ```

## üìä SUMMARY

**Git Repository**: ‚úÖ **VERIFIED AND CURRENT**
- Latest commit: `c6743be` (comprehensive config docs)
- All commits pushed to GitHub
- Working tree clean

**Vercel Deployment**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES MANUAL DASHBOARD VERIFICATION**
- Site rate-limited (429) - cannot verify deployed version remotely
- Deployment ID timestamp suggests recent activity
- Manual verification in dashboard required to confirm pin status

**Next Steps**:
1. Wait for rate limit to clear (~5-10 minutes)
2. Check Vercel Dashboard for production deployment status
3. Verify commit hash matches latest: `c6743be`
4. Confirm auto-deploy settings correct
5. Test production site when accessible
