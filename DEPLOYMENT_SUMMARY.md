## 🧪 TESTING & VERIFICATION

### How to Test the Wizard

**Desktop:**
1. Visit https://pgclosets-store-ewtigioh8-peoples-group.vercel.app
2. Scroll down to 40% page depth → wizard appears (scroll-trigger)
3. Click "Quick Configure" on any door type tile → wizard opens with that door
4. Complete all 3 steps → see estimate with 4 CTAs

**Mobile:**
1. Visit site on mobile device
2. Tap "Estimate" button in sticky bar at bottom
3. Complete wizard (optimized for mobile)
4. Note: No video loads (static image only, saves 1.8MB)

**Analytics:**
1. Open GA4 Real-time view
2. Trigger wizard using any entry point
3. Observe events: `estimator_wizard / opened / [entry_point]`
4. Complete steps and watch funnel tracking

### Performance Testing

**Bundle Size:**
```bash
npm run build
# Check: Homepage First Load JS = 181KB (was 225KB)
```

**Lighthouse Audit:**
```bash
lighthouse https://pgclosets-store-ewtigioh8-peoples-group.vercel.app --view
# Target: Performance 90+, FCP <1.8s, LCP <2.5s
```

**Mobile Testing:**
```bash
# Use Chrome DevTools mobile simulation
# Network tab: Verify video NOT loaded on mobile
# Lighthouse mobile audit: Check mobile scores
```

## 🔄 ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### If Issues Arise

**Option 1: Revert to Previous Deployment (Fastest)**
```bash
# Revert to Phase 4 (pre-performance optimization)
vercel promote pgclosets-store-mvcjux5nd-peoples-group.vercel.app

# Or revert to Phase 3 (pre-integration)
vercel promote pgclosets-store-5bqqzcc42-peoples-group.vercel.app
```

**Option 2: Git Revert**
```bash
# Revert last commit
git revert HEAD
