export const BARN_DOOR_FAQ: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "How do Renin barn doors work?",
    answer: "Renin barn doors slide along a top-mounted track using premium roller hardware. They feature soft-close technology that gently catches the door before it hits the wall, preventing damage and noise. The doors are solid core for durability and sound dampening."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between barn doors and bypass doors?",
    answer: "Barn doors slide on an exposed track mounted above the door frame, creating a statement design element. Bypass doors slide inside the closet frame on concealed tracks, saving space. Barn doors work best for single openings, while bypass doors are ideal for wide closet openings."
  },
  {
    question: "Can barn doors be installed in heritage homes?",
    answer: "Yes, our installation team has extensive experience with Ottawa's heritage homes. We carefully work around existing crown molding, heritage trim, and architectural details. Renin barn doors can complement heritage aesthetics with the right finish and hardware selection."
  },
  {
    question: "Do barn doors provide privacy and sound dampening?",
    answer: "Renin barn doors feature solid core construction that provides good sound dampening. For maximum privacy, we recommend adding door seals. While barn doors don't seal as tightly as traditional hinged doors, they're excellent for closets, pantries, and non-bedroom applications."
  }

export const BYPASS_DOOR_FAQ: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What are bypass doors?",
    answer: "Bypass doors are sliding closet doors that operate on tracks inside the door frame. Two or more door panels slide past each other, allowing access to half the closet at a time. They're space-efficient and perfect for bedrooms, as they don't require clearance to swing open."
  },
  {
    question: "Can bypass doors be installed in existing closet openings?",
    answer: "Yes, Renin bypass doors can be installed in most standard closet openings. We measure your existing frame and order doors to fit. Installation typically takes 2-3 hours and includes all necessary hardware and tracks."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I clean and maintain bypass doors?",
    answer: "Wipe panels with a soft, damp cloth and mild soap. Avoid abrasive cleaners. Vacuum tracks regularly to prevent debris buildup. The roller bearings are self-lubricating and maintenance-free. With proper care, Renin bypass doors will operate smoothly for decades."

export const BIFOLD_DOOR_FAQ: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What are bifold doors?",
    answer: "Bifold doors are hinged in the middle and fold open along a top or bottom track. They provide full access to the closet opening and take up minimal space when open. Renin bifold doors feature smooth-operating hardware and are available in many styles and finishes."
  },
  {
    question: "Are bifold doors noisy?",
    answer: "Renin bifold doors use quality hinges and track systems that operate quietly. With proper installation and adjustment, they should open and close smoothly without squeaking or rattling. We ensure proper alignment during installation for optimal operation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can bifold doors be painted or stained?",
    answer: "Many Renin bifold doors come pre-finished, but paintable options are available. If you want a custom color, select an unfinished or paint-grade door. We recommend professional painting for best results. Finished doors should not be painted or stained as it voids the warranty."
