## Known Non-Issues

### `/api/status` - 503 Response
**Status:** Expected Behavior âœ…

This endpoint intentionally returns 503 when the database is unavailable or degraded. In development mode without a connected Supabase instance, this is normal and expected. The endpoint is functioning correctly - it's reporting degraded status as designed.
